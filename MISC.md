# Miscellaneous

There some things that are good to know, but not strictly necessary. Here's an (incompplete) list of the ideas. Please feel free to add any 'life hacks' you know/discover to this!

## Clone depth

In old repos, there's ususally a lot of history. So, cloning them often takes many GBs, while the actual code you'd like to download(to, for example, browse around) is only a few dozen MBs. To get around this, we can use `git clone --depth 1`. For example, `git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:pytorch/pytorch.git` takes significantly less time than cloning the entire repo.

## Aliases

There are some commands that we use all the time(for example, `git status`). To avoid typing `status` every single time, we can tell git to interpret `git s` as `git status`. To do this, run

```bash
git config --global alias.s status
```

You can replace `s` with anything other alias. The `--global` flag tells git that we want this setting to be applied everywhere.

## gitconfig

You can make a lot of tweaks to git to make it better. For example, if you misspell commands all the time, you can tell git to autocorrect you and run the command in a couple of seconds:

```bash
git config --global help.autoCorrect 50
```

This will autocorrect your commands(for example, from `git rebaes` to `git rebase`) in 5 seconds and run it.

Some other common options are(thanks @Animeshz for these):

```bash
git config --global user.email <email> # set your default commit email
git config --global user.name <full-name> # set your default commit name
git config --global core.editor code  # use vscode to edit commit messages etc
git config --global core.editor vim  # use vim to edit commit messages etc
git config --global core.editor nano  # use nano to edit commit messages etc

```
