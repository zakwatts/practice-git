# Forks and PRs

Git makes working with and suggesting changes to open source code seamless. Let's try making changes to some code on github, and ask for our changes to be integrated in the original codebase.

You probably want to read the entire document before you start, so that you have a general idea about what's happening, and because there are some instructions after the task is described.

## Forking

To make changes, let's start by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository. You should see a fork button when you open the link in a browser. Simply click it, and let github create a fork for you. You should be taken to your version of the repository(the fork) automatically.

You can now make changes by using this as a starting point for your work, or you can make some changes and suggest them to the original repository.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests allow you to suggest certain changes you have made to the main repository. Your changes can then be incorporated in the original (usually called upstream) repository(i.e, your *pull request* is *merged*).

Start by editing the following line:

- [X] git is awesome!

Check the box saying git is awesome. You can do this **in the browser** by clicking on this file name(README.md) in the code explorer, and then clicking the edit button(little pencil icon). See [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-your-repository) if you are having trouble with this step.

Then, change the `[ ]` in the line above to `[x]`. You can then save the changes to your repository by clicking the commit changes button. Optionally, you can specify a commit message to describe the changes you made.

After you have commited the changes, you can [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Go to the root of your repository, and you should see a contribute option. Open a pull request, and allow edits from maintaners.
